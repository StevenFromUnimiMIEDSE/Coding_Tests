1. standard flow to rank solutions
2. Iterations, improve on test results
3. Flow paradigm is improvement from naive prompt
4. Rag
5. Graph is like gardrail version of Rag
6. Langchain documentation expression language
7. parse out answer, format
8. Alpha codium paper workflow is simplified to another solution locally

Code
1. Doc on langchain expression language
2. three components to prep first step
3. State, dictionary to the problem solving process
4. every node change states
5. generation node works on generation and iteration
6. If state is error, retry, append
7. if not error, generate result
8. iteration register
9. avoid making the same error
10. code execution, check error or ok to proceed
11. no error, code execution on going
12. conditional check on output state, error to regenerate, no error go to next
13. workflow
14. worfflow to functions
15. LCEL

Test
1. Execution error was appened to the prompt based on first solution
2. please retry to answer, prompt to retry
3. new test works, result is the functionable code
4. check prefix, imports, code
5. statistics showed that 50% success without langraph, with, 80% success rate. 
6. point 5 is the average, not considering the error range(error bar).
